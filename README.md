# Data science portfolio - Joanna Kaczorowska
## My learning journey through data science

In this repository, I will share projects written in R language, in which I analyze the data from my own studies (done during my PhD) and from publically available databases.

# Data analyzed during PhD
## Project 1 - Early-life colonization by Beta- and Gammatorquevirus in infants

Language written: R
Key packages used: tidyverse, dplyr, rstatix

This is the R code for the _Early-life colonization by Beta- and Gammatorquevirus in infants_ paper, published in _Viruses_ in 2022.
It is a simple study, which involved minor data manipulation, but a lot of data visualization.
